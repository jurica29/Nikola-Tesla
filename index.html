      <p>
        Nikola Tesla may be the most influential and prolific inventor you've
        never heard of. Over the course of his lifetime, Tesla was a prolific
        inventor. He obtained nearly 300 patents worldwide for his designs and
        ideas. Some of Tesla's other inventions and innovations include the
        following: a high-voltage transformer now known as the Tesla coil,
        electric oscillators, generators, meters, induction motors, RADAR
        technology, improved lights, X-rays, radio communications, remote
        control technology that used radio signals, and rotating magnetic
        fields, which became the basis of most AC machinery.

                <h2>Tesla begins career as an electrical engineer</h2>
                <p>
                  He moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph
                  company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone

                  draftsman in another company. ` He was given the position of
                  chief electrical engineer.

                <p>
                  After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to
                  transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This
                  was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his
                  famous `Tesla coil.`
